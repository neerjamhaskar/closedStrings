# Closed Strings 

This project computes the following within a given string. For each input string, the program computes:
- The **maximal right-closed array (MRC)** of a given string $w[1..n]$ in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$-time.
- The **compact representation** for all closed substrings of a given string $w[1..n]$ in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$-time. 
- All **maximal closed substrings (MCSs)** of a given string $w[1..n]$ in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$-time.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for computing all the above mentioned data structures and strings. 
- `strings/` - Contains `smallStringArrayGenerator` tool and sample text files for generating suffix arrays and LCP arrays for small substrings.

## Installation and Compilation

### Compiling and executing the Small String Array Generator

1. **Navigate to the `strings/` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd strings
    ```

2. **Compile** the `smallStringArrayGenerator`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Run the generator** to create suffix and LCP arrays for a given string. Below is an example of usage:

    ```bash
    ./smallStringArrayGenerator
    ```

    - **Example Input**:
      - Text: `abacaba`
      - Filename: `t1`

    - **Expected Output Files**:
      - `t1` - Original text file with the string.
      - `t1.sa` - Binary file containing the Suffix Array.
      - `t1.lcp` - Binary file containing the LCP Array.

### Compiling and Executing the closedStrings program

Once you have generated the necessary input files, you can proceed to compile and execute the closedStrings program in the `src` folder.

1. **Navigate to the `src/` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2. **Compile** the closedStrings program:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This will generate an executable named `closedStrings`.

3. **Run the closedStrings program**:
    ```bash
    ./closedStrings <text_file_without_extension> [cs|mcs]
    ```

- Input File Format
The input files should follow this format:
    - `<file_name>` - Text file containing a sequence of 1-byte characters.
    - `<file_name>.sa` - Binary file representing the Suffix Array, with each element as a 4-byte integer.
    - `<file_name>.lcp` - Binary file representing the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) Array, with each element as a 4-byte integer. The LCP[0] = 0 is assumed. 
    - **Note:** all these files are assumed to be in the same directory. 

- Input Parameters
    - Replace `<text_file_without_extension>` with the base name of your files.
    - **`cs`** — Computes a **compact representation of all closed strings** of $w[1..n]$.
    - **`mcs`** — Computes **all maximal closed strings** of $w[1..n]$.
    - **Note:** Both options will also compute the **MRC array**, which contains auxiliary data relevant to the closed string computations.

## Examples

### Small String Generation Example
    
    vscode ➜ /workspaces/closedSubstrings/strings (main) $ make
    g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -o smallStringArrayGenerator smallStringArrayGenerator.cpp
    vscode ➜ /workspaces/closedSubstrings/strings (main) $ ./smallStringArrayGenerator
    Enter the string to compute SA and LCP: mississippi
    Enter the base filename: t4
    String, SA, and LCP array written to t4, t4.sa, and t4.lcp

- Note that the `smallStringArrayGenerator` executable only computes SA and LCP for strings that have a length < 10000. 

### Compact Representation of all Closed Strings

    4: (4,1), (1,0), 
    5: (2,1), 
    6: (1,0),
